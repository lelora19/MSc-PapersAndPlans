30.12.21:
For Sniper Simulation:
V1. Go over rob timer and environment and how it's all related to pin (preferrably, document what I can while understanding sniper code) - with Freddy
V2. What files did Dan change so we can merge them into Sniper - with Dan
3. Micro Arch discussion: what to change in sniper files, what to check for our research. Go over Dan's paper reviews. - with Freddy and Avi
4. Fix counters casting issue (some time prints are negative) and add counters for power - with Freddy and Avi
5. *Try* to run with gdb debugger. If it works, it's better than intermediate prints. - Layan (Avi's idea)

VFor Research Proposal: (Timeline goal: By End of January)
V* We want to improve the MicroArch in uOps.
V* Planning to fix and improve over Dan's work: How does the uOp size affect the results, Make timing more accurate, etc.
V* Proposal shuold be 2-3 pages:  1. Our goal; 2. What did Dan do, what do I want to do; 3. Timeline for my work and mini goals.

4.2.22:
To get the sniper working version without vp:
  * git reset --hard 9d5ea41165ce1bf6efea0ac25d0ef87d927a95c2
3.3.22:
To get the sniper working version with vp:
  * git reset --hard f6763071fec11f1c71048acba4fdee9c051ed4d4

10.2.22:
* run with 1 core (not 4), check if idle time is still negative. If yes, check snipersim website bug fixes and discussion groups about a casting problem.
* how does different predictors pick which values to predict (index or sum result)?
* experiment different tests and draw graphs: #loops vs different params (e.g., #instruction or array size)
