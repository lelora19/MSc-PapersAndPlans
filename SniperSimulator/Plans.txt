For Sniper Simulation:
1. Go over rob timer and environment and how it's all related to pin (preferrably, document what I can while understanding sniper code) - with Freddy
2. What files did Dan change so we can merge them into Sniper - with Dan
3. Micro Arch discussion: what to change in sniper files, what to check for our research. Go over Dan's paper reviews. - with Freddy and Avi
4. Fix counters casting issue (some time prints are negative) and add counters for power - with Freddy and Avi
5. *Try* to run with gdb debugger. If it works, it's better than intermediate prints. - Layan (Avi's idea)

For Research Proposal:
* We want to improve the MicroArch in uOps.
* Planning to fix and improve over Dan's work: How does the uOp size affect the results, Make timing more accurate, etc.
* Proposal shuld be 2-3 pages:  1. Our goal; 2. What did Dan do, what do I want to do; 3. Timeline for my work and mini goals.
