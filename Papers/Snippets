1. CAL: Comp Arch Letter (4 pages?): we get quick response and feedback
2. Conferences: Micro or ISCA 2023


Pros & Cons of our arch.:
pro:  slow path is seperate from the fast path
      we don't need to store the values forever, only during training
con: flush, power evaluation, what is the area overhead, what is the effect of instruction fetch throughput on value prediction?


Short-term plans:
1. Start with vp simple then add stride/vtage.
2. Model two flows: correct prediction-> no penalty, dependency was broken
                    incorrect prediction-> penalty + rollback (flush).
3. Ports of VRT: 1 for lookup. For snooping: as much as the number of load units of exe
